****************************
Don't vacation NEAR the lake...vacation ON the lake! Relax in our adorable floating houseboat on Lake Allatoona. Kitchen, bathroom and shower! Click the ❤️to Wishlist us!

Our boat has been lovingly maintained and updated using beautiful reclaimed materials. You'll find her relaxing, cozy, & comfortable. Sip morning coffee or evening cocktails on the deck overlooking our beautiful cove with amazing views.

A sweet houseboat with a main cabin (living room) that sleeps 2 on the Full size pull out sofa. Queen size bed in the bedroom area (with draw curtains for privacy) and a dining bench which converts to a Full size bed (best for kids or adventurous adults.) You can also pitch a tent or hang a hammock on the top deck to slumber al fresco.

FAQ:

Q: Location?
A: White, GA on Lake Allatoona
The boat is located in a private marina where our boat is slipped. You'll have a stunning view of the cove and sunsets in our coveted end slip space with unrestricted view angles.

Q: How can I see all of your listings for rent?
A: Click on our Airbnb profile (the round photo) & scroll all the way to the bottom below the aggregated reviews (on Mobile) or look to the left (on Desktop). You’ll see all of our listings - or check them out by clicking the link below:

Listing Page: https://www.airbnb.com/users/633945/listings

Q: 1 Night Reservations?
A: We kindly ask that you do NOT instant book for 1 night reservations. We handle 1 night reservations on a case-by-case basis depending on availability. We will respond to an inquiry promptly, most of the time immediately.

Q: Is it comfortable?
A: Yes! Our boat was designed with live-aboard ☆ stay-aboard in mind with all the comforts of home. We've stocked the kitchen, used premium furnishings, provided WiFi, TVs, a Keurig … etc. Just bring your swimsuit!

Q: How to book:
A: If you don’t have any questions after reading over the FAQ below then simply use Instant Book. If you send an inquiry we’ll respond promptly.

Q: Why is the price so different for my dates?
A: Airbnb automatically sets our prices based on demand & seasonality. If you don’t search with exact dates, Airbnb shows the lowest price throughout the season. Prices range from about $87 per night for weekday day-of bookings in January all the way to $300+ per night for weekends during peak summer season, special events and everywhere in-between.

Q: Bathroom… explain!
A: The boat is equipped with an apartment sized water heater ensuring you get hot water throughout the boat. You'll always have enough hot water to enjoy a 10 - 15 minute shower. The boat has a marine toilet that is easy to use as long as you follow our simple instructions.

Q: Heat? Air Conditioning?
A: Our boat is equipped with BOTH ample Heat & Air Conditioning. No matter the time of year, you can be assured that you will be staying in climate controlled comfort.

Q: Can we take the boat out on the lake?
A: No. We don’t carry insurance for self-charters and the boat stays permanently docked for a variety of reasons. We DO however have a 26' Tritoon that is available for rental (separate from the houseboat.)

Q: Can I check in earlier than 4 or check out later than 11?
A: We will do our best. Most days there’s someone checking in on the same day there’s a checkout, but we try to go above and beyond if this is requested. If it's available, you can order extra hours for an additional fee at our concierge link provided upon booking.

Q: Is there housekeeping during our stay?
A: Generally, no. However, you can order cleaning to be provided as often as you wish for an additional fee (subject to our housekeeper's availability) at our concierge link provided upon booking.

Q: Can we fish from the dock or boats?
A: Absolutely! We ask that you fish from the back of the vessel and stay clear of the props so your line doesn’t get prop/shaft wrapped. Fishing from the dock is also allowed as long as you mind the props of the other vessels. You can easily get a fishing license from the Department of Natural Resources online. We operate on the honor system and don’t check for licenses but ask that you support the local DNR and pay the small fee to make it legal. We can't be responsible for any fines you may incur if you don't get your fishing license. There are several bait and fishing shops you may rent/buy fishing equipment from in the area.

Q: What to expect that's different than a hotel?
A: It's a boat! It is a unique, FUN experience. There are probably noises and smells that you'd expect from a boat in water. Pumps, motors, lake water, etc. We take great care of our boat, but we expect guests to tell us if anything isn’t working properly and we will respond promptly. Think of it as ""glamping"" and your expectations will be exceeded.

Q: Waves?
A: The marina has a wall which minimizes waves. There is still a small amount of wave action and you'll feel a slight rock from time-to-time, mostly from boats passing by who don’t respect the 'no wake zone' (feel free to yell at them and shake your fist while doing so.) If there's a bad storm or the rocking action gets to a point that your stay is no longer enjoyable, we will do our best (no guarantees) to work out alternate accommodation as a COURTESY for you, as we have another listing about 35 minutes away in Marietta. Your comfort is our top priority. 99% of the time the marina is flat and calm.

Q: Will you reduce your price?
A: No (-ish)... Maybe, but unlikely. Don’t expect a price reduction unless it’s the slow season & you’re messaging about days within 1-4 days of check-in or you’re looking for a long-term stay in the off season (see next “Q”). If you message us with a booking that somewhat fits the criteria above & tell us a budget we can try & work with you. “Will you reduce the price of a weekend booking a month away” will always be a “no”.

Q: Do you do long-term or monthly rentals?
A: Possibly. From March 1 - November 15 the boat is rented at a 90% occupancy rate, so the monthly rate is only slightly reduced compared to the daily rate (around 10%). From mid-November through February we’re much more flexible depending on length of stay.

Q: Smoking?
A: On the outside only & please be responsible. Kindly don’t light the boat on fire - we need it to stay afloat!

Q: Do you allow dogs?
A: You bet! We ask that dogs not be puppies, don’t scratch at doors, flooring, carpet or anything else, and don’t bark incessantly. Dogs must always be on-leash, as per marina rules. Dogs may not enter the inside cabin space, but may be free to stay on the dock, deck and outside upper deck areas. You may not leave your dog alone on the boat. The boats are close together and a non-stop barking dog isn’t appreciated. An additional $75 non-refundable pet fee PER DOG is applied for those who travel with them. It also should go without saying: No messes on the decking, and you MUST pick up after your dog.

Q: Can we hold events or parties?
A: No. This is a place to relax. We ask that there be no events or parties on the boats so the other guests can enjoy their stay.

Q: You charge extra for more than 4 adults, do my kids count?
A: Any child over the age of 3 is considered a paying guest and needs to be represented in the booking inquiry as an additional guest.

Q: Wheelchair accessible?
A: Unfortunately, no.

Q: Parking?
A: Yes, you can park your car. Since it’s a small private marina, the walk to the parking lot from the boat is quite short, though we are at the end of our particular dock (it has the BEST views!)

Q: Will this be the best vacation I’ve ever had and should I book now?
A: Without a doubt.

You get to park for free as close to the boat as possible in the parking lot. There are dock carts if you want to use them to haul your luggage and stuff down the ramp to the boat.

You will receive an access code to open the key lock box for both the boat key and the gate card just before the time your reservation begins. We recommend you leave the key inside the lock box whenever you leave the dock so that it doesn't get lost. ***IF YOU ARRIVE AFTER 5PM the parking lot gate will be CLOSED. You will need to walk down to the dock and collect the gate key from the lockbox in order to gain access for your vehicle. Please make sure you bring a good flashlight, as it is a several minute walk.***

You will be given all instructions needed to access the boat for your stay prior to arrival. We are always available to answer any questions or concerns for you, and we do our best to address any individual problems ASAP for you to ensure you have an enjoyable stay! Your satisfaction is our #1 goal!

The marina is a very fun community of ""lake life"" neighbors and boaters. Everyone will want to come say hello! Say hello back, share a beer and enjoy the sunsets!

I highly recommend using ride-sharing services if you don't have a vehicle:

For free Uber credit, use my code - emilyc3562ue
For $20 in Lyft credit, use my code - emily27414

☆1 night rentals: We do them but on a case-by-case basis. Please inquire for 1 night rentals. DO NOT send Instant Book for 1 night rentals - however, we will promptly respond to a reservation request. Most of the time we will respond within minutes.

☆PETS: Allowed with pre-approval. Non-refundable pet fee of $75 will be charged. We do not accept pets that fall into the following categories:

→No dogs that bark excessively or scratch/dig.
→No dogs who attack or chase other dogs (or humans!) as there may be dogs with other marina guests.

☆If you arrive AFTER 5pm, the gate will be CLOSED. You will need to walk around the gate and down to the dock to retrieve the gate key card from the key lock box at the houseboat in order to open the gate and drive through to the parking lot. Please keep track of both the boat key and the gate card - there will be a $50 replacement fee per item.","Oven

It sits in the peaceful town of Chester, AR across from the blue water of Clear Creek, minutes from Lake Fort Smith, hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, a passenger train ride and UTV trails. Each of our 11 guest rooms is designed around a common fear or human experience. Rosy's Room is based on our friend's life, Rosy Alexander, who was born in Nepali, raised in Canada, and lives in the US now. It is a reflection on the immigrant experience and the courage it requires to adapt in different environments while challenging, reinterpreting, and reconnecting with our roots. Not only was the room inspired by Rosy's roots, but Rosy is an interior designed and designed the room. The room has a King bed and is perfect for 1-2 guests looking to find solace in distant and peace-filled land right in the heart of America. The inn has 11 cozy private rooms upstairs which are furnished in antique décor. The rooms include one suite with its own private bathroom and a large second suite with a kitchenette.

""Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. And lo, no one was there."" This quote was carved into a mantle of another historic Inn. I first read it the night that my husband proposed to me. I have learned and lived by this. When fear creeps up and knocks I muster all my courage, sometimes I really am still really scared however I have found that when I simply open the door by faith darkness and fear are dispelled. This has taught me so many lessons but one big one is that we are haunted by many things all kinds of things. We are terrified of what someone may say about us on the internet, the opinions of our neighbors, taking in the stranger, we worry about our children or evening having children, and then we worry about growing old and our children growing older- the list goes on. These fears are not a physical monster on the other side of the wall or walking down the hall, but they are ideas that we let hide in our minds that we allow to keep us keep us scared. Here at the Beard and Lady we have decorated our rooms inspired by fears we have faced or are overcoming. We ask each guest to join us bravely. One of the ways I have faced my own fear is simply by saying it out loud, writing it down or even confessing to a friend. While you stay, we ask that depending on your room you would dive into the full experience with us. Each room will have a writing prompt and stamps.

This room is decorated with old family photographs of children and has a collection of antique children's toys. Some people love this room it may stir up nostalgia of childhood and others have expressed being afraid of children and feeling uneasy about all the decor. I was inspired to design this room off my own fascination with childhood and how quickly its gone. My children scare me daily but seeing how quickly their own childhood is slipping away I cling to the nostalgia of their pictures.

It sits in the peaceful town of Chester, AR across from the blue water of Clear Creek, minutes from Lake Fort Smith, hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, a passenger train ride and UTV trails.

The Geisha Room, this room is a favorite with its gorgeous brass bed and ornate wood furniture. kimono from my great grandfather hangs on display as well as a geisha. The word geisha consists of two kanji: gei (芸, meaning 'art') and sha (者, meaning 'person' or 'doer'). The most literal translation of geisha in the English language would be ""artist"" but honestly ""artist"" does not give an accurate description of all a geisha represented. They have a long rich history that is fascinating to explore but one thing that stands out is their role as protectors of (Japanese) tradition. We hope this room might cause you to pause reflect on your own traditions worth protecting.

The inn has 11 cozy private rooms upstairs which are furnished in antique décor. The rooms include one suite with its own private bathroom and a large second suite with a kitchenette.

Is it haunted?

""Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. And lo, no one was there."" This quote was carved into a mantle of another historic Inn. I first read it the night that my husband proposed to me. I have learned and lived by this. When fear creeps up and knocks I muster all my courage, sometimes I really am still really scared however I have found that when I simply open the door by faith darkness and fear are dispelled. This has taught me so many lessons but one big one is that we are haunted by many things all kinds of things. We are terrified of what someone may say about us on the internet, the opinions of our neighbors, taking in the stranger, we worry about our children or evening having children, and then we worry about growing old and our children growing older- the list goes on. These fears are not a physical monster on the other side of the wall or walking down the hall, but they are ideas that we let hide in our minds that we allow to keep us keep us scared.

Here at the Beard and Lady we have decorated our rooms inspired by fears we have faced or are overcoming. We ask each guest to join us bravely. One of the ways I have faced my own fear is simply by saying it out loud, writing it down or even confessing to a friend. While you stay, we ask that depending on your room you would dive into the full experience with us. Each room will have a writing prompt and stamps. Please be prepared for our ask of sending a letter or post card. Sounds scary right? Are you ready to be totally freaked out?....... Leave your phone at the door and face your inner fears.","Heating

We took out a hive of bees that had made a very large home inside the floor of this room that we now affectionately call the ""honey"" room, This room is decorated with velvet teal curtains, simple furniture and portraits of women. It was inspired by my travels to Turkey. Lance and I were once on a hike in Turkey and came across a bee keeper. We did not share a common language but it did not stop him from being generous. He gladly insisted we tried his bee's honey. This moment in time created a deep memory for me. My time in Turkey taught me many lessons on generosity, how to be a good host and to be thankful for the simple sweet things in life * Beware!

Is it haunted?

""Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. And lo, no one was there."" This quote was carved into a mantle of another historic Inn. I first read it the night that my husband proposed to me. I have learned and lived by this. When fear creeps up and knocks I muster all my courage, sometimes I really am still really scared however I have found that when I simply open the door by faith darkness and fear are dispelled. This has taught me so many lessons but one big one is that we are haunted by many things all kinds of things. We are terrified of what someone may say about us on the internet, the opinions of our neighbors, taking in the stranger, we worry about our children or evening having children, and then we worry about growing old and our children growing older- the list goes on. These fears are not a physical monster on the other side of the wall or walking down the hall, but they are ideas that we let hide in our minds that we allow to keep us keep us scared.

Here at the Beard and Lady we have decorated our rooms inspired by fears we have faced or are overcoming. We ask each guest to join us bravely. One of the ways I have faced my own fear is simply by saying it out loud, writing it down or even confessing to a friend. While you stay, we ask that depending on your room you would dive into the full experience with us. Each room will have a writing prompt and stamps. Please be prepared for our ask of sending a letter or post card. Sounds scary right? Are you ready to be totally freaked out?....... Leave your phone at the door and face your inner fears.","Dishes & Utensils

Located at the front corner of the building, the Writer's Block Room is the perfect place to stay if you’re looking for windows of inspiration. With fun creative decor and a typewriter, the Writer's Block Room is perfect for 1-2 guests looking to unplug and look within to get into a creative flow.

The Writer's Block Room is based on the concept of stifled creativity and lack of a clear direction. It reminds us that every writer (or artist) sometimes feels uninspired or stuck, and a fresh environment can be the best remedy. The artist inside of us all wants to flow with creative purpose and this room is a reminder to pause and remember that life ebbs and flows. We can all be creative if we give the time and space to create and innovate.

Nestled in the Ozark Mountains in the center of Chester, Arkansas: a small town of approximately 150 people set along the A&M railroad, our inn is the antidote for the status quo. The Beard and Lady Inn is surrounded by the Ozark National Forest where nature enthusiasts can summit the highest peaks in the Ozark Mountains. With over 1.2 million acres to explore, hikers, bikers, canoers, hunters, UTV riders, and campers have access to endless excursions. Chester began as a timber town on Frisco, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway. What followed was an unpredictable story of growth, fire, floods, and redemption.

Our inn offers space for contemplation, curiosity, and memory making. There are no screens, but you can stay and read a book, ride a train, walk the creek across the street, play a game, have a mountain bike or side by side adventure and send a postcard in our small post-office. We are within walking distance to Clear creek, the Chester Country Cafe, and 6 miles from the Buckhorn OHV Trail system for amazing side by side riding. We are minutes from Lake Fort Smith (hiking, biking, canoeing, fishing), 30 min to Fayetteville and Fort Smith, and 7 minutes into Mountainburg. Try quail, chukar, and pheasant hunting at Quail Mountain Hunting Preserve on the adjacent mountain.

Is it haunted?

""Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. And Lo, no one was there."" This quote was carved into a mantle of another historic Inn. I first read it the night that my husband proposed to me. I have learned and lived by this. When fear creeps up and knocks I muster all my courage, sometimes I really am still really scared however I have found that when I simply open the door by faith darkness and fear are dispelled.. This has taught me so many lessons but one big one is that we are haunted by many things all kinds of things. We are terrified of what someone may say about us on the internet, the opinions of our neighbors, taking in the stranger, we worry about our children or evening having children, and then we worry about growing old and our children growing older- the list goes on. These fears are are not a physical monster on the other side of the wall or walking down the hall but they are ideas that we let hide in our minds that we allow to keep us keep us scared. Here at the Beard and Lady we have decorated our rooms inspired by fears we have faced or are overcoming . We ask each guest to join us bravely. One of the ways I have faced my own fear is simply by saying it out loud, writing it down or even confessing to a friend. While you stay we ask that depending on your room you would dive into the full experience with us. Each room will have a writing prompt and stamps. Please be prepared for our ask of sending a letter or post card. Sounds scary right? Are you ready to be totally freaked out?....... Leave your phone at the door and face your inner fears.","Microwave

Surrounded by the Ozarks, this 130+ year old building was restored in 2020 keeping its historic charm. There are 11 guest rooms themed around a human fear or experience, a dining hall, kitchen, mercantile store, and convention hall with stage. It sits in the peaceful town of Chester, AR across from the blue water of Clear Creek, minutes from Lake Fort Smith, hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, a passenger train ride and UTV trails.

This room is decorated with finds from the Middle East. In my 20's I lived in Cairo and made many life long friends there and in the states from this region. The Middle East is as diverse and full of rich history and tradition as any southern American state. We like to boast about Southern hospitality but I would have to credit the Arabs I have spent years with in friendship for teaching me about their art and customs of a generous host. I am still humbled by the elaborate meals and fan fair that many family's insisted I was worthy of. This room is one of the few that has the option to connect to the adjoining room, #11 the one suite with its own private bath. If you are interested in booking both rooms please let us know.

The inn has 11 cozy private rooms upstairs which are furnished in antique décor. The rooms include one suite with its own private bathroom and a large second suite with a kitchenette. All rooms have shared access to 8 toilets (6 upstairs and 2 down) and 6 showers. Downstairs is a dining hall, kitchen, mercantile store, convention hall with stage, outdoor patio, stream with two bridges, and outdoor patios. The dining hall is where guests and the public will have shared access to eat. The mercantile styled apothecary shop is where you’ll find Beard and Lady goods, our own line of apothecary-inspired personal care and grooming products, as well as handmade products made by local artisans. The convention hall can be rented for events and live music. The inn is famous among locals, travelers, and Hollywood directors for its supernatural past, endurance through disaster, and history of American railroad grit.

* Beware! You might be challenged with the task of writing a post card or letter and sending it.

The charming Tudor-style rows of inner Chester are one part of the charismatic sphere the city creates. Cobbled streets with double-level shopping are what makes Chester so unique to the world-boasting independent boutiques, galleries, and high street favourites scattered throughout. Within a matter of miles, why not take a short trip to Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet, Liverpool, or Manchester for high-end, designer finds?

Quirky and vibrant, Chester offers some of the North West’s best restaurants, independent coffee shops, and bustling bars. Whether you prefer an award-winning dining experience or some tasty, homely grub; there are so many options across Chester and its suburbs to find a totally traditional or oddly offbeat menu to suit your taste!

How about joining the Cheshire elite at Britain’s oldest racecourse, the Roodee, for an unforgettable day or evening at the Races? First opening in 1539, the Roodee racecourse is a fabulous location to watch Horse racing or Polo, mingle with some famous faces, and sip on some of the finest champagne at the ‘jewel of Chester’s crown.’ Races run annually from Spring-Autumn.

When getting from the property to Chester, as with any city, it’s always best to go in by foot as finding parking can always be a struggle.

Luckily for you, the property is in the ideal location and parking can be found as per the check-in instructions.

Just park up, leave your car there, and stroll into the beautiful city that is Chester. Chester also has a great taxi service if you're looking to go further afield.
